2023/10/01 08:15,Just landed at SFO. The morning fog is still lingering around. It reminds me of the term "雾都" (City of Fog) which I heard before for San Francisco. I want to delve deeper into the history of San Francisco's iconic fog.
2023/10/01 13:37,Grabbed a coffee at Blue Bottle. I overheard a couple discussing tech startups in a mix of English and Mandarin. It's amazing how global this city feels. Maybe I should attend a tech meetup to understand the startup culture here.
2023/10/01 20:23,Strolled across the Golden Gate Bridge during sunset. The interplay of the orange sky and the red bridge was breathtaking. I'm curious about the construction history of the Golden Gate Bridge.
2023/10/02 10:10,Visited Chinatown. There's this blend of traditional and contemporary vibes. Ate some 叉烧包 (Char Siu Bao) and it tasted just like home. I want to learn more about the migration history of Chinese in San Francisco.
2023/10/02 14:54,Attended a meeting in Palo Alto. Impressed by the innovative energy in the room. Need to follow up on a few connections made today. I'm thinking about setting up an informational interview with a startup founder to learn more about the Valley's ecosystem.
2023/10/02 23:45,Writing some code now. Encountered a bug where the software is defaulting to simplified Chinese. Need to investigate this. I wonder about the evolution of traditional to simplified Chinese and its impact on tech.
2023/10/03 11:55,Toured Stanford. Amazed by its sprawling campus. 在这里走走真的很舒服 (Walking around here is really comfortable). I should read up on the history of Stanford and its famous alumni.
2023/10/03 18:20,Met a friend for dinner in Cupertino. She introduced me to a new Szechuan restaurant. The 辣子鸡 (spicy chicken) was on point! It'd be interesting to understand the culinary journey of Szechuan cuisine in the US.
2023/10/04 09:45,Visited the Apple Park Visitor Center. I couldn't resist buying an exclusive San Francisco themed Apple shirt. I'm eager to know more about the design philosophy of Apple's products.
2023/10/04 22:34,Spent most of the evening debugging. Fixed the localization issue. It was an overlooked setting in the system preferences. This makes me wonder about the history of software localization and its challenges.
2023/10/05 14:20,Went hiking at Muir Woods. The redwoods are majestic. 感觉自己变得好小 (I felt so small in comparison). I'm inspired to learn about the ecosystem of redwood forests and their preservation efforts.
2023/10/05 21:12,Another coding session tonight. Worked on optimizing some algorithms. Also, reviewed some markdown files and made them more readable. I should explore the origins of markdown and its adoption in the tech industry.
2023/10/06 16:03,Explored Fisherman's Wharf. Loved the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl. The sea lions at Pier 39 were entertaining to watch. I want to learn the history of Fisherman's Wharf and its significance to the city.
2023/10/06 23:50,Wrapping up my Bay Area visit. This trip was a mix of leisure, work, and inspiration. I can't wait for my next journey here. I'll definitely spend some time researching the places I've visited to appreciate them even more during my next trip.
