## Journal
I visited Chinatown today, and the blend of traditional and modern vibes caught my attention. While savoring 叉烧包 (Char Siu Bao), I wondered about the migration history of the Chinese community here. Later, in a meeting in Palo Alto, I was impressed by the innovation and have thought about setting up an informational interview with a startup founder. In the evening, while coding, I stumbled upon a software localization issue and got curious about the transition from traditional to simplified Chinese in the tech world.
